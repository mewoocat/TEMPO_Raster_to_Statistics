### Methods
- Data from the TEMPO mission is recieved in a NetCDF format, which contains latitude and longitude points assciated with the level of a given product in Dobson units.
- The program recieves a directory containing the NetCDF files to analyze.  The data points along with the products levels from these files are combined into a GeoDataFrame from the GeoPandas python library.
- County or Census Tract shape files are imported into the program and converted into a GeoDataFrame containing an entry for each region in the shape files.
- The data and geographic GeoDataFrames are anaylzed for intersections, and a specified statistic is performed on the product values for each geogrphic region.
- Additionally the latitude and longitude values of the points in a region are collected and stored in the resulting combined GeoDataFrame.
- Finally, the GeoDataFrame is converted to a CSV file and exported the path specified.
